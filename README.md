This repository stores my source codes when I learned web development at The Odin Project. I hope that anyone who needs to look at other resources can find this repository helpful.

<h2>I have learned</h2>

- Languages: HTML, CSS (Flexbox), JS

<h2>File Structures</h2>

- `css-exercises`: All CSS exercises forked from [The Odin Projects GitHub](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises). This folder also contains my solution codes.
